# Cardiovascular Emergency Response system

```
The Cardiovascular Emergency Response system leverages innovative technologies such as Langchain and Langgraph, combined with Redis, to create a robust support framework. Its primary aim is to assist patients promptly by efficiently collecting data from relevant medical documents. By integrating real-time data processing and natural language understanding, the system ensures that critical information is readily accessible to healthcare providers. This approach is designed to enhance response times during stroke emergencies, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. Through this solution, we expect to facilitate quicker recovery for individuals experiencing cardiovascular events.
